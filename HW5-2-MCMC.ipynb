    "# Introduction\n",
    "In 1953, Metropolis, Rosenbluth, and the Teller couple published a paper titled *Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines* proposing a random algorithm for using computers to solve the statistical properties of strongly correlated many-body systems. In this article, they performed calculations on a two-dimensional rigid sphere model. The key idea of the paper is to view the phase space of the canonical ensemble as a probability space. If the coordinates of N particles are given, one can calculate the energy (potential energy) of this configuration. Since the potential energy depends only on the positions and not on the velocities, the integration over momentum degrees of freedom in the phase space can be eliminated. **Hence, the statistical properties of the system are only related to the potential energy part**.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<A> = \\frac{\\int A e^{-E/ \\tau} d^{3N}q}{Z}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $Z$ is the partition function, $E$ is the total energy, and $\\tau$ is the temperature. The key idea of the algorithm is to use a random walk to sample the phase space."

    "An intuitive approach is to randomly assign particle coordinates, calculate the physical quantity $A$ and the energy $E$ of the configuration, and then apply the statistical weight $e^{-E/\\tau}$. Finally, the weighted average of the physical quantity $A$ is obtained. This method is feasible for sparse systems, but for dense systems, the majority of configurations have extremely small weights (due to high energy caused by overlap), making it difficult to sample configurations with large weights. As a result, the algorithm's efficiency becomes extremely low. The authors proposed a modified method known as the famous **Metropolis algorithm**: instead of randomly and uniformly sampling configurations and assigning them weights $e^{-E/τ}$, configurations are selected according to their probabilities, which are proportional to  $e^{-E/τ}$. This way, it is more efficient to sample configurations with larger weights and improve the algorithm's efficiency.Specifically, the algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "- 1 Randomly initialize the coordinates of N particles and calculate their energy.\n",
    "- 2 Randomly select a particle and move it from qi to qi+αξ, where α is the step size (manually set) and ξ is a uniformly distributed random number in the range [-1, 1]. To reduce boundary effects, the authors used periodic boundary conditions.\n",
    "- 3 Calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the new configuration and the original configuration. If the energy of the new configuration is lower, it is \"accepted.\" If the energy is higher, generate a random number ε from a uniform distribution in the range [0, 1]. If ε is less than e^(-ΔE/τ), the new configuration is \"accepted\"; otherwise, it is \"rejected\" and the system is restored to the configuration before the move.\n",
    "- 4 Regardless of whether the new configuration is accepted or rejected, the configuration after steps 2 and 3 is considered a sampled configuration.\n",
    "- Repeat steps 2-4 multiple times until a sufficient number of sampled configurations (denoted as M) are obtained to control statistical errors within an acceptable range."

    "For the desired physical quantity, compute the unweighted sample average, which represents the result of a single \"experiment\". Sometimes, higher-order moments of the physical quantity may also be needed, and these moments are likewise results of a single \"experiment\".\n",
    "The above describes the Metropolis algorithm, with step 4 being its core. It is evident that this is a Markov process, where each transition (steps 2-4) yields a state, and the transition probability P(Xn+1=x|Xn=xn) from the nth state to the n+1th state is independent of n."
